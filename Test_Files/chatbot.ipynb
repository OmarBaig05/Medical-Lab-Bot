      "['\\n\\nThe classification of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is based on specific clinical and laboratory criteria. Under the older World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, DHF is defined by four key criteria:\\n\\n1. **Fever**: The patient must present with a fever.\\n2. **Hemorrhagic Tendency**: This can be spontaneous bleeding or a positive tourniquet test result.\\n3. **Thrombocytopenia**: A platelet count of ≤100,000 cells/mm³.\\n4. **Plasma Leakage**: Evidence of plasma leakage, such as pleural effusion, ascites, or hemoconcentration of ≥20%.\\n\\nThese criteria do not require laboratory confirmation of dengue virus infection for diagnosis. \\n\\nIn contrast, the 2009 WHO classification introduced a severity-based approach, categorizing dengue as either \"dengue\" or \"severe dengue.\" Severe dengue is characterized by:\\n- Plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress,\\n- Severe bleeding, or\\n- Organ failure (e.g., elevated liver enzymes, impaired consciousness, heart failure).\\n\\nThis shift emphasizes clinical judgment and includes more non-specific warning signs, such as abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, and mucosal bleeding. However, it does not always require laboratory confirmation, which can affect the interpretation of test results.\\n\\nWhen interpreting a DHF test report, it\\'s essential to consider whether the old or new criteria are being used. The old criteria rely on specific lab parameters like platelet count and plasma leakage, while the new classification may include a broader range of clinical signs without requiring lab confirmation. This distinction can influence how severity is assessed and how the results are applied in clinical practice.', '\\n\\n1. **Dengue IgM Antibody Testing**:\\n   - **Test Description**: The IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) detects IgM antibodies against dengue virus. It uses antigens derived from the envelope proteins of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4).\\n   - **Timing**: IgM antibodies are detectable starting 4–5 days after symptom onset and remain positive for approximately 12 weeks. Combined testing with NAAT or NS1 antigen is recommended during the first 7 days of illness.\\n   - **Specimens**: Serum, plasma, whole blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used, though CSF is only recommended for encephalitic cases.\\n\\n2. **Interpretation of Results**:\\n   - **Positive IgM**: Indicates presumptive recent dengue infection.\\n   - **Negative IgM**: If negative between days 0–7, a second sample should be collected after day 7 for further testing. If negative after 7 days, the infection is unlikely.\\n   - **Seroconversion**: A change from negative to positive IgM in paired samples confirms current infection. IgG seroconversion may also indicate past infection but is not recommended for acute diagnosis.\\n\\n3. **Cross-Reactivity**:\\n   - IgM and IgG results may show cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, yellow fever). Plaque Reduction Neutralization Testing (PRNT) is recommended for confirmation in such cases.\\n\\n4. **Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and Microneutralization Tests**:\\n   - **Purpose**: These tests detect and measure neutralizing antibodies to confirm specific dengue infection, especially when ruling out other flaviviruses.\\n   - **Use Cases**: Used for confirming recent infection in paired acute and convalescent specimens.\\n\\n5. **IgG Testing**:\\n   - **Limitations**: Not recommended for diagnosing acute infections as it detects past infections. IgG may remain positive for years after infection.\\n\\n6. **Clinical Considerations**:\\n   - Early testing (first 7 days) may require both IgM and NAAT/NS1 antigen tests for accurate diagnosis.\\n   - Convalescent phase specimens are necessary if initial tests are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.\\n\\nThis information helps interpret dengue test results, considering the timing of sample collection, test limitations, and the need for confirmatory testing in certain cases.', '\\n\\n1. **Interpretation of PRNT Results for Dengue Infection:**\\n   - **Single Dengue IgM-positive specimen showing neutralizing antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype:** Confirms recent infection with that serotype.\\n   - **Seroconversion from negative PRNT in acute sample to positive PRNT with antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype in convalescent sample:** Confirms recent infection with that serotype.\\n   - **4-fold rise in PRNT titers in paired acute and convalescent samples with antibodies to multiple dengue virus serotypes or other flaviviruses in the convalescent sample:** Indicates a recent flavivirus infection.\\n   - **PRNT showing neutralizing antibody titers for dengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses in a single dengue IgM-positive specimen:** Classified as a recent flavivirus infection.\\n   - **Cases may be re-classified as another flavivirus (e.g., Zika) based on PRNT results.**\\n   - **Negative PRNT or microneutralization results on a dengue IgM-positive sample during acute illness:** Indicates no detectable neutralizing activity. IgM-positive result remains presumptive in the absence of confirmatory tests (PRNT, microneutralization, NS1, or NAAT).\\n\\n2. **Specimen Types:**\\n   - Serum and CSF can be used for testing.\\n\\n3. **Availability of PRNT and Microneutralization Tests:**\\n   - Performed at CDC or a CDC-designated laboratory.\\n   - Public health laboratories may refer IgM-positive specimens to CDC for PRNT to confirm positive, equivocal, or inconclusive IgM results.\\n   - In some resource-limited countries, PRNT and microneutralization tests may not be available.']\n"

Dengue IgM Antibody Testing:**\\n- **Test Description:** \\n  - Uses MAC-ELISA to detect IgM antibodies against dengue virus antigens.\\n  - Detectable 4-5 days post-symptom onset, remains positive for 12 weeks.\\n\\n- **Specimens:** \\n  - Serum, plasma, whole blood, and CSF (for encephalitic cases).\\n\\n- **Interpretation:**\\n  - **Positive IgM:** Indicates recent infection.\\n  - **Negative IgM:** If negative within 0-7 days, retest after day 7. Negative after 7 days suggests no infection.\\n  - **Seroconversion:** Change from negative to positive confirms infection.\\n\\n- **Cross-Reactivity:** \\n  - IgM/IgG may cross-react with other flaviviruses (e.g., Zika). PRNT recommended for confirmation.\\n\\n**3. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and Microneutralization Tests:**\\n- **Purpose:** \\n  - Detect and measure neutralizing antibodies to confirm dengue infection, especially when cross-reactivity is suspected.\\n\\n- **Use Cases:** \\n  - Used for confirming recent infection in paired acute and convalescent specimens.\\n\\n**4. IgG Testing:**\\n- **Limitations:** \\n  - Not recommended for acute diagnosis as it indicates past infection, remaining positive for years.\\n\\n**5. Clinical Considerations:**\\n- **Early Testing:** \\n  - Within the first 7 days, use both IgM and NAAT/NS1 antigen tests for accuracy.\\n  - If initial tests are negative but suspicion remains, test convalescent phase specimens.\\n\\n**6. Interpretation of PRNT Results:**\\n- **Scenarios:**\\n  - Single IgM-positive with neutralizing antibodies to one serotype: Confirms recent infection.\\n  - Seroconversion in paired samples: Confirms recent infection.\\n  - 4-fold titer rise in paired samples: Indicates recent flavivirus infection.\\n  - Neutralizing antibodies to multiple viruses: Classified as recent flavivirus infection.\\n  - Negative PRNT in IgM-positive sample: No detectable neutralizing activity, IgM result remains presumptive.\\n\\n**7. Specimen Types and Availability:**\\n- **Specimens:** \\n  - Serum and CSF are used for testing.\\n- **Availability:** \\n  - PRNT and microneutralization tests are mainly at CDC or designated labs, potentially unavailable in resource-limited settings.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nUnderstanding DHF\\'s classification and the nuances of IgM and PRNT tests is essential for interpreting medical reports accurately. Clinicians must consider test timing, cross-reactivity, and the need for confirmatory tests to ensure reliable diagnoses and appropriate patient management.'"

      "Generated text:  ['The lab report highlights key differences between Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in terms of clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Notably, DHF patients had a significantly higher incidence of rash (77.5% vs. 27.3%, p<0.001) and hemorrhage (72.5% vs. 3.7%, p<0.001), which are critical distinguishing features. Fever was nearly universal in both groups, but DHF patients also showed higher rates of nausea/vomiting and cough, though these differences were not statistically significant. In terms of laboratory findings, DHF patients were more likely to present with thrombocytopenia (90.0% vs. 76.8%, p=0.047) and monocytosis (57.6% vs. 26.2%, p=0.001), while leukopenia (24.3% vs. 45.4%, p=0.015) and neutropenia (47.1% vs. 26.3%, p=0.018) were less common. Elevated liver enzymes, particularly ALT (84.4% vs. 57.3%, p=0.004), were also more frequent in DHF patients, indicating greater hepatic involvement. These findings underscore the more severe clinical and hematological manifestations of DHF compared to DF.', 'The report emphasizes the clinical and laboratory distinctions between DF and DHF, with DHF characterized by a higher prevalence of rash (77.5% vs. 27.3%, p<0.001) and hemorrhage (72.5% vs. 3.7%, p<0.001), which are hallmark features of the more severe form of the disease. Laboratory findings further support the severity of DHF, with significant differences in thrombocytopenia (90.0% vs. 76.8%, p=0.047), leukopenia (24.3% vs. 45.4%, p=0.015), and elevated liver enzymes, particularly ALT (84.4% vs. 57.3%, p=0.004). These findings collectively highlight the importance of early identification and management of DHF to prevent complications.']\n",

Women who are Rh(D) negative and have a fetus who is Rh(D) positive can have a healthy pregnancy; however, in subsequent pregnancies, an Rh(D) positive fetus is at risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Therefore, Rh(D) negative women who are carrying an Rh(D) positive fetus are treated prophylactically with Rh(D) immunoglobulin at 28 weeks' gestation and within 72 hours of delivery.

Organ system /Panel delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. Rheumatoid factor (RF), serum IMM 1.4 <15 IU/mL RF is an antibody that reacts with the Fc portion of other immunoglobulin G antibodies. Despite its name, RF lacks speciﬁcity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can be seen in other inﬂammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, particularly Sj€ogren syndrome. RF can be a prognostic indicator in RA as its presence correlates with increased severity of disease. RF has a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of about 70% and 85% for RA, respectively. Combination of RF and anti- citrullinated peptide antibodies have a higher diagnostic yield than RF alone. Skeletal, Autoimmunity Salicylate, serum CHEM 1.7 Therapeutic: < 30 mg/dL Aspirin has a short half-life (15 min) and is rapidly metabolized to salicylate. In aspirin overdose, cyclooxygenase inhibition leads to platelet dysfunction and gastric mucosal injury; stimulation of the medulla resulting in hyperventilation, respiratory alkalosis, nausea and vomiting; and disruption of cellular metabolism (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) which can cause metabolic acidosis. Serum salicylate levels above 40 mg/dL typically result in toxicity. Symptom onset is usually within 3–8 h, but absorption rates are not uniform. Timing and concentration of peak serum levels can vary depending on the amount and form of aspirin ingested; therefore, serial\n",

It may be seen in a variety of situations and is characterized by generalized bruising and bleeding, usu- ally from venepuncture sites, post-​operatively, and spontaneously. Diagnosis requires FBC, clotting screen, and evidence of rapid consump- tion of fibrinogen. Classic (acute) DIC, where the test results fit the bill, is easy to spot. The situation may be more subtle and you are strongly advised to discuss the case with a haematology registrar or consultant if you are in any doubt about the diagnosis of DIC.

Because of their complexity, platelet function tests will not be described in detail here. Patients generally present with bleeding or bruising problems and have had normal coagulation results. Because of the labour-​intensive nature and cost of these assays, you will need to arrange these tests after discussion with your local haematology medical staff. • Sample: blood collection needs to be optimal with non-​traumatic venepuncture, rapid transport\n",

VHFs are severe febrile illnesses that can be complicated by a haemorrhagic tendency, petechiae, hypotension (and even shock), ﬂushing of the face and chest, and oedema. Constitutional symptoms such as headaches, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea may occur. Some VHFs manifest particular features not shared by the others. 3. Once suspected, VHFs are category 4 pathogens, so precautions for healthcare workers must be instituted and the case notiﬁed to the proper authorities. Isolation measures and barrier nursing procedures are indicated (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa and Congo- Crimean HF viruses may be particularly prone to aerosol nosocomial spread), usually in a special infectious diseases/tropical medicine unit staﬀed with clinicians with expertise in the ﬁeld. Intensive supportive care may be required. 5. Almost always, the true diagnosis will not be a VHF, but they must be considered where appropriate. Strict adherence to isolation and infection control precautions has prevented secondary transmission in almost all cases. 4. Diagnosis requires clinical expertise in infectious diseases/tropical medicine. The diﬀerential diagnosis includes malaria, yellow fever, dengue, typhoid/ paratyphoid fever, non-typhoidal salmonellae, typhus and other rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, shigella dysentery, relapsing fever (borreliosis), fulminant hepatitis and meningo coccal disease. Antigen tests, antibody detection and viral culture are all available for most of the VHFs. The patient should be fully investigated and treated accordingly.

An eGFR of >60 in the absence of other evidence of kidney damage should be considered normal. • CKD G3a: moderate d in GFR 45–​59mL/​min/​1.73m2. • CKD G3b: moderate d in GFR 30–​44mL/​min/​1.73m2. • CKD G4: severe d in GFR 15–​29mL/​min/​1.73m2. • CKD G5: established renal failure (ERF) GFR <15mL/​min/​1.73m2 or on dialysis. The staging for albuminuria quantification is then added as follows: • A1—​albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) <3mg/​mmol. • A2—​ACR 3–​30mg/​mmol. • A3—​ACR ≥30mg/​mmol. Using this staging system, a person with an eGFR of 48mL/​min/​1.73m2 and an ACR of 25mg/​mmol has CKD stage G3a, A2. Classification of CKD in this way allows identification of those with severe disease in need of specialist assessment and can be used to guide BP targets and frequency of monitoring in those with less severe disease.2 Serum urea Urea is the product of protein catabolism in the liver. Production is i by high protein intake, catabolic states, breakdown of blood in the gut lumen in GI bleeding, and tetracycline treatment, and may d in liver disease. Urea is freely filtered at the glomerulus, with variable reabsorption, which is influenced by extracellular volume status. Intravascular volume depletion, diuretics, CCF, GI bleeding, tetracyclines, and renal failure cause elevated levels. Disproportionate rise in serum urea, compared to creatinine, occurs in hypovolaemia and GI bleeding. Reduced levels are seen in chronic liver disease and alcohol abuse. By itself, serum urea is a very poor marker of excretory kidney function. 1 KDIGO. Guidelines. M http://​kdigo.org/​guidelines/​. 2 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2014).

This is reversible if the necrosis is limited to the renal tubules (acute renal tubular necrosis) but irreversible if the glomeruli are also destroyed (renal cortical necrosis). Fibrin deposits may also result in mechanical damage to RBCs with hemolysis. Hematology 395 Occasionally, fibrin deposited in the small vessels of the fingers and toes leads to gangrene and loss of digits and even arms and legs. Laboratory Findings Laboratory findings vary with the intensity of the disorder. In subacute DIC, the findings are thrombocytopenia, a normal to minimally prolonged prothrombin time (PT), a short partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a normal or moderately reduced fibrinogen level, and an increased level of fibrin degradation products. (Because illness stimulates increased fibrinogen synthesis, a fibrinogen level in the lower range of normal [eg, 175 mg/dL] is abnormal in a sick patient and raises the possibility of impaired production resulting from liver disease or increased consumption from DIC.) Acute, massive DIC produces a striking constellation of laboratory abnormalities: thrombocytopenia; a very small clot (sometimes not even visible), noted when blood is allowed to clot in a glass tube; a markedly prolonged PT and PTT (the plasma contains insufficient fibrinogen to trigger the end point of coagulation instruments, and test results are often reported as more than some value [eg, > 200 sec], which is the interval before the automated Hematology 396 instrument shifts to the next sample in the machine); a markedly reduced plasma fibrinogen concentration; a positive plasma protamine paracoagulation test for fibrin monomer; and a very high level of plasma D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in the serum. Specific clotting factor assays will reveal low levels of multiple clotting factors, particularly factors V and VIII, which are inactivated because activated protein C is generated during DIC. Massive hepatic necrosis can produce laboratory abnormalities resembling acute DIC. The factor VIII level is elevated in hepatic necrosis because factor VIII is an acute-phase protein that is\n",
      "- will be normal. Each son of a carrier has a 50% chance of being a hemophiliac, and each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier. Rarely, random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in early embryonic life will result in a carrier's having a low enough factor VIII or IX level to experience abnormal bleeding. A patient with a factor VIII or IX level < 1% of normal has severe bleeding episodes throughout life. The first episode usually occurs before age 18 mo. Minor trauma can result in extensive tissue hemorrhages and hemarthroses, which, if improperly managed, can result in crippling musculoskeletal deformities. Bleeding into the base of the tongue, causing airway compression, Hematology 390 may be life threatening and requires prompt, vigorous replacement therapy. Even a trivial blow to the head requires replacement therapy to prevent intracranial bleeding. Patients with factor VIII or IX levels about 5% of normal have mild hemophilia. They rarely have spontaneous hemorrhages; however, they will bleed severely (even fatally) after surgery if not managed correctly. Occasional patients have even milder hemophilia with a factor VIII or IX level in the 10 to 30% of normal range. Such patients may also bleed excessively after surgery or dental extraction. Laboratory Findings By measuring the factor VIII level and comparing it with the level of VWF antigen, it is often possible to determine whether a female is a true carrier of hemophilia A. Similarly, measuring the factor IX level often identifies a carrier of hemophilia B. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA in the factor VIII gene amplified from lymphocytes is available at a few specialized centers. This test allows identification of the hemophilia A carrier, either directly by recognition of a known specific genomic defect in the pedigree, or indirectly through study of restriction fragment length Hematology 391 polymorphisms linked to the factor VIII gene. These techniques have also been applied to the diagnosis of hemophilia A\n",

      "  - **Hemorrhagic Tendency:** Spontaneous bleeding or positive tourniquet test.  \n",
      "  - **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count ≤100,000 cells/mm³.  \n",
      "  - **Plasma Leakage:** Evidence such as pleural effusion or hemoconcentration ≥20%.  \n",
