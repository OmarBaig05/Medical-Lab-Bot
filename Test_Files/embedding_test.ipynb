Complete Blood Count The Complete Blood Count (CBC) Panel is a group of four specific tests which provides results regarding the concentration of White Blood Cells (WBC), Red Blood Cells (RBC), Platelets, as well as the concentration of Hemoglobin and Hematocrit within a blood sample.3 The CBC can provide information regarding an individual’s overall health and is utilized as a differential diagnosis of a variety of disease and conditions, including anemia, infection, and leukemia.3 Monitor vital signs (Adult Vital Sign Interpretation in Acute Care Guide 2021),28 use a symptom-based approach, and collaborate with the interprofessional team regarding risk vs. benefit of physical therapy intervention with abnormal findings in the context of the complex clinical condition. White Blood Cells (Leukocytes) play a crucial role in the immune system by providing protection against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. WBC testing is utilized to identify the presence of infection and conditions that cause inflammation, allergic reactions, and cancers of the blood and lymphatic system. Fluctuations of WBCs occur at all ages but are greatest in infants. Pre-term and full-term infants have physiologically higher baseline WBC count, compared to adults.29 Reference Ranges (per mm3)3 Newborn: 9,000-30,000 Child ≤ 2 years: 6,200-17,000 Child > 2 years/adult: 5,000-10,000 Possible Critical Values: < 2,500 or > 30,000 Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is the total neutrophil granulocytes present in the blood. Consider protective isolation/reverse precautions when ANC < 1,000/mm3 as a result of severe immunocompromise and increased infection risk.3 ANC Guidelines30: ANC Value Risk for Infection < 500/mm3 Highest 500-1000/mm3 Moderate > 1000/mm3 Low Trending Upward Leukocytosis Causes3 Presentation1 Clinical Implications Items below are for adults and pediatrics (birth to 18 years) unless otherwise specified.
