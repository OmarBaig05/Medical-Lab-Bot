PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC3202316 PMID: 21832264 Since the 1970s, dengue has been classified as dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued a new, severity-based clinical classification which differs greatly from the previous classification.Abstract Dengue has emerged as a major public health problem worldwide. Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations. Since the 1970s, clinical dengue has been classified according to the World Health Organization guideline as dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The classification has been criticized with regard to its usefulness and its applicability. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued a new guideline that classifies clinical dengue as dengue and severe dengue. The 2009 classification differs significantly from the previous classification in both conceptual and practical levels. The impacts of the new classification on clinical practice, dengue research, and public health policy are discussed. The exponential increase in published dengue research in recent years emphasizes the global importance of this infectious disease. Dengue is an important health threat to a large proportion of the worldwide population, with an estimated 3.6 billion persons at risk of this infection [1–3]. In addition to well-known areas of endemicity in Southeast Asia, dengue has become endemic in South and Central America. Dengue has now been reported in areas not previously affected and areas where the disease was thought to be controlled [1–3]. Furthermore, dengue, previously considered to be largely a pediatric illness, has been increasingly reported in adults [4–7]. The expansion of dengue geographically and demographically underscores the need for an appraisal of the clinical classifications with regard to their applicability and usefulness in clinical management and research. Historically, dengue was considered to be a debilitating but not fatal illness. During the late 1960s, outbreaks of fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in children in Southeast Asia changed this perception [8–11]. Clinical information from these outbreaks formed the basis for a dengue clinical classification published in the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline in 1975 and updated in 1997 [12, 13]. Clinical dengue is classified as dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Figure 1). Dengue fever is defined as a febrile illness with at least 2 clinical findings, including nausea, vomiting, headache, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, rash, myalgia, hemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia. Because of the lack of specificity of these clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory or epidemiological evidence of dengue virus infection is required for a confirmed diagnosis. The definition of DHF consists of 4 clinical criteria: fever, a hemorrhagic tendency (spontaneous bleeding or a positive tourniquet test result), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, ≤100000 cells/mm3), and plasma leakage as shown by pleural effusion, ascites, or ≥20% hemoconcentration. Of importance, the specificity of this syndrome means that a diagnosis of DHF does not require laboratory evidence of dengue virus infection. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Dengue classification according to the World Health Organization guidelines issued in 1975 and 1997. Dengue is classified as (1) undifferentiated fever, (2) dengue fever (DF), and (3) dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In addition to fever and at least 2 clinical findings, diagnosis of DF requires epidemiological or laboratory evidence supporting a dengue virus infection. To meet a case definition of DHF, all 4 criteria are required: (1) fever, (2) hemorrhagic manifestations, (3) thrombocytopenia (platelet count, ≤100000 platelets/mm3), and (4) evidence of plasma leakage. Diagnosis of DHF does not require laboratory support.Several criticisms have been raised against the case definition of DHF. Reports have argued that the case definition of DHF is too rigid and too difficult to apply in primary care or resource-limited settings [14–18]. Another criticism has been that the case definition fails to identify a significant proportion of severe dengue cases. For example, severe manifestations, such as encephalopathy and hepatic failure, are not included in the DHF case definition. It has also been questioned whether the case definitions, which were developed primarily on the basis of data derived from pediatric cases in southeast Asia, are applicable to other regions and populations. Consequently, a multicenter study to define clinical dengue was conducted (the Dengue Control [DENCO] study), and on the basis of its findings, a new clinical classification of dengue disease has been published in the most recent WHO guideline and subsequently promulgated [19, 20]. Although an effort to publish the findings is underway, the supporting data for the new classification have been, up to this point, largely inaccessible for evaluation [21]. A recent follow-up study from the same investigators indicates that the revised classification is undergoing evaluation regarding its applicability and usefulness [22]. The new WHO guideline classifies dengue as dengue and severe dengue (Figure 2). The definition of (nonsevere) dengue is somewhat similar to that of DF: a combination of ≥2 signs and symptoms in a febrile individual in an area of endemicity. However, the signs and symptoms listed in the revised classification are more numerous and less specific than those listed in the 1997 classification. They include aches and pains, nausea, vomiting, and rash. In addition, abdominal pain and tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement are included in the list of clinical findings suggestive of dengue and also serve as warning signs for potentially severe dengue. Severe dengue is classified as cases including any of the following: (1) plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress, (2) severe bleeding, or (3) organ failure (eg, elevated liver enzyme levels, impaired consciousness, or heart failure). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Dengue classification according to the World Health Organization guidelines issued in 2009. Dengue is classified as dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue. Diagnosis of dengue requires the presence of fever and at least 2 clinical findings or any warning signs. Epidemiological or laboratory evidence is required to make the diagnosis. Severe dengue is defined as dengue with any of the following: (1) severe plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress, (2) severe hemorrhage, or (3) any organ failure.The 2009 clinical classification represents a significant departure from the prior classification. In contrast to the previous classification, which defines DHF as a clinical entity with plasma leakage as the cardinal feature that differentiates it from DF, the 2009 classification lists several clinical manifestations as qualifiers for severe dengue. The improvement in dengue-associated mortality over the past decades has been based on the understanding of the natural history of plasma leakage in DHF, which occurs around the time of defervescence and coincides with the nadir of the platelet count. Delayed detection and treatment of plasma leakage is the major cause of organ failure, listed as severe manifestations in the 2009 classification. By listing severe organ involvement as a criterion for severity separate from plasma leakage, the revised classification places emphasis on isolated organ failure as a common and significant cause of dengue severity. With the exception of liver failure, which has been reported to occur in ≤1% in moderate to severe adult dengue cases [23, 24], the frequencies of severe organ impairment in the absence of plasma leakage have not been well documented. Most reports of isolated severe organ impairment consist of case reports or small case series [25–31]. On the basis of our prospective study involving children, severe organ involvement in the absence of plasma leakage is, in fact, uncommon [32]. In an attempt to include these unusual dengue manifestations, the 2009 classification has unfortunately reduced the emphasis on the most important aspect of dengue disease and the major factor contributing to fatality. The 2009 severity-based classification stems from an argument that DHF case definition does not effectively identify severe dengue. It is important to indicate that the DHF case definition is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings to define a clinical syndrome rather than disease severity. Consistent with this, we found in a recent analysis that patients with DHF are not uniformly severe [32]. However, the risk of severe disease as defined by a requirement for intervention was significantly higher among patients with DHF than among those with DF. Therefore, the case definition of DHF affords significant discriminating value for clinical severity. Indeed, a recent study comparing the 2 classifications revealed that the 2 classifications perform comparatively well in identifying severe dengue, defined according to requirement for intervention [33]. Another important aspect of the 2009 classification that reflects its intended use as a case-management tool is the inclusion of nonspecific warning signs as diagnostic criteria for probable and potentially severe dengue cases. As such, a patient presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting in an area of endemicity during the dengue season will qualify as a probable dengue case. On the basis of the statistics from the outpatient department at Queen Sirikit National Institute for Child Health in Bangkok in 2008, the new case definition would have qualified an additional 39000 cases as probable dengue, whereas only 1600 suspected dengue cases were detected using a positive tourniquet test result and leukopenia as screening tools [34]. Among the latter, 76% were confirmed dengue cases by serologic testing (unpublished data). Patients with warning signs warrant close monitoring according to the new guideline, posing a significant burden for resource-poor countries where dengue is highly endemic. In addition, the requirement for laboratory confirmation is not clearly stated for severe dengue in the 2009 classification. Without laboratory confirmation, an unknown number of cases that qualify as severe dengue may not be dengue, because of the nonspecific nature of the criteria. In contrast, the DHF case definition excludes 99% of nondengue cases without the need for laboratory tests [32]. Implementation of the 2009 case definitions of probable and severe dengue without laboratory confirmation will certainly inflate the number of dengue cases and further complicate resource allocation and implementation of preventive measures. The revised classification also poses significant problems for dengue research. Because the revised classification is designed primarily as a case-management tool, less emphasis is placed on the underlying pathophysiology. In contrast to the previous classification, which defined DHF as a clinical entity with a common pathophysiological process, the 2009 classification makes no such distinction. This reflects the notion that “dengue is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome,” as indicated in the 2009 guideline [19, p. 11]. Consequently, severe dengue in the new classification includes cases with diverse and potentially unrelated underlying mechanisms. For instance, patients with highly elevated liver enzyme levels may be classified as having severe dengue regardless of the presence of other clinical findings (eg, plasma leakage or hemorrhage). This poses a problem for research studies that focus on specific manifestations (eg, plasma leakage) of dengue disease, because patients classified as having severe dengue may or may not have manifestation(s) relevant to a particular research question. This would require more-specific designations of severe dengue for research (eg, severe dengue with plasma leakage, severe dengue with liver failure, or severe dengue with heart failure). Although the severity-based classification is the central feature of the proposed classification, most of these severe manifestations are not well defined in the guideline and others are based on arbitrary laboratory cutoff values. Indeed, the severity is based mostly on clinical judgment and will lead to heterogeneity in the classified groups because of variation in clinical practice. This is in contrast to the previous classification, which depends on objective findings only. Moreover, shock and severe organ involvement can be manifestations of the disease, complications of delayed or inappropriate treatment, underlying health conditions, or even adverse effects of medications. For example, fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, listed as a criterion for severity in the new classification, is often a complication of overtreatment with intravenous fluids. Because severity can be modified by intervention, which varies significantly from place to place, the 2009 definition of severe dengue will reflect the underlying disease severity and the regional and local clinical practice. It is questionable whether such a classification would be useful in research. The dynamic nature of dengue demands close monitoring and repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations. Failure to obtain information, such as hematocrit and platelet counts, at the critical period is the primary reason for the difficulties in applying the DF-DHF classification. Unfortunately, this is prevalent even in recent prospective studies. For example, a subsequent study by the DENCO investigators showed that the maximum hematocrit reading was available in only 12% of cases [22]. The inconsistent application of the DF-DHF classification, largely because of the lack of critical information, has led to confusion and misunderstanding. It is imperative that research studies include sufficient detail on clinical data to justify their conclusions. As dengue continues to expand globally, the clinical classification will need to be reexamined and modified. However, loosening of the criteria for case classification and, in particular, incorporation of heterogeneous disease manifestations and mechanisms in a single classification, is not helpful. Despite its limitations, the DHF case classification has proved to be useful for advancing important observations on dengue disease pathogenesis, such as the importance of secondary dengue virus infection to the plasma leakage phenomenon, and has been instrumental in the development of treatment regimens that have saved numerous lives.

IgM levels are positive starting 4–5 days after onset of symptoms and continuing for approximately 12 weeks post symptom onset but may persist longer. IgM antibody testing can identify dengue infections, but cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses should be considered when interpreting results. IgM Antibody Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (MAC-ELISA) What is the test? The dengue MAC-ELISA is used for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies against dengue virus. The MAC-ELISA is based on capturing human IgM antibodies on a microtiter plate using anti-human-IgM antibody, followed by the addition of dengue virus antigens. The antigens used for this assay are derived from the envelope proteins of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4). How should it be used and at what time during infection? As the immune system fights the infection, IgM antibodies against dengue virus are detectable starting 4–5 days after onset of symptoms and are reliably detectable for approximately 12 weeks. Combined testing with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and MAC-ELISA usually provides a diagnostic result during the first 1–7 days of illness. A convalescent phase specimen is needed to make a diagnosis of dengue virus infection when results are negative on both tests from the acute specimen. IgM antibody detection is not useful for dengue virus serotype determination. Specimen types Serum Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Keep in mind‎ Some IgM tests can be performed on plasma and whole blood, but these tests have not been extensively evaluated for these specimen types. IgM detection is also possible in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, obtaining a CSF sample is only recommended for encephalitic cases. Interpretation of results Positive IgM: Patients with a positive IgM test result in a single sample are classified as presumptive, recent dengue virus infections. Negative IgM: Patients with a negative IgM result between days 0–7 of illness, and absent or negative NAAT or NS1 results, are considered unconfirmed cases. For these cases, a second sample should be obtained after day 7 of symptoms for additional serologic testing. Patients with negative IgM results after 7 days of symptoms, and absent or negative NAAT or NS1 (dengue virus antigen detection), are classified as negative for recent infection. Patients with a change from negative to positive IgM results in paired samples (first sample collected during the first 7 days of illness, and second sample collected after symptoms subside) are classified as current dengue infections. Seroconversion: Seroconversion is observed when an acute sample (usually collected during the first day of illness), and a convalescent sample (collected after 7 days), are tested for IgM. If test results change from negative to positive, the patient is diagnosed with current dengue. Negative results on both samples are a strong indication the patient was not infected with dengue virus. IgG seroconversion may also be used to diagnose dengue. However, IgG testing is not recommended in a single specimen. The presence of these antibodies may indicate a previous dengue virus infection. Cross-reactivity of dengue serological tests: Due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses and possible nonspecific reactivity, IgM and IgG results may be difficult to interpret. Consequently, presumed positive, indeterminate, and equivocal, IgM antibody test results may be forwarded for confirmation by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). See below. Availability Dengue IgM serologic tests are available as laboratory-developed tests in public health and commercial clinical laboratories. Only one U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared dengue IgM detection kit is commercially available. IgG testing is available in some clinical labs. The CDC does not recommend IgG testing on a single specimen for the diagnosis of acute dengue infections. IgG Testing Serologic testing by IgG ELISA in a single specimen is not recommended for diagnosis of acute dengue in patients. These tests may detect antibodies from dengue infections or other flavivirus infections that occurred in the past. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and microneutralization tests What are these tests? PRNT is a biological assay based on the virus and antibody interactions. It results in virus inactivation such that the virus is no longer able to infect and replicate in cell culture. PRNT can detect and measure the titer of specific neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus and other flaviviruses from the serum of an infected patient. PRNT is used to more precisely determine the cause of infection in IgM positive patients for whom a specific diagnosis is clinically or epidemiologically important (e.g., to rule out other flaviviruses such as Zika or yellow fever). PRNT is a labor-intensive and relatively costly test. A single PRNT test result cannot help determine infection timing. PRNT results from paired acute and convalescent specimens can be used to confirm recent infection. The microneutralization assay is based on the same principle as the PRNT. The assay uses a colorimetric or fluorometric measurement of numbers of infected cells. This assay was developed to use less reagents and for testing a larger number of samples. How should PRNT and microneutralization tests be used? PRNT and microneutralization tests can be used when a specific serologic diagnosis is required to rule out Zika or other flaviviruses of concern. For example, in pregnant women or in cases of clinical and epidemiologic importance. These tests are used to confirm the infecting virus in a dengue or Zika virus IgM-positive specimen. In some cases, it can determine the infecting dengue virus serotype. For residents living in areas with dengue and Zika virus circulation, or for travelers with multiple long-term exposures, PRNT and microneutralization tests may have less utility in differentiating flavivirus infections. Clinicians should contact local health departments to find out the usefulness and availability of PRNT testing as a confirmatory test for IgM positive cases. Specimen types Serum CSF Interpretation of results PRNT performed on a dengue IgM-positive specimen showing neutralizing antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype will confirm recent infection with that serotype. A seroconversion from a negative PRNT in an acute sample to a positive PRNT with antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype in a convalescent sample will confirm a recent infection with that serotype. An indication of a recent flavivirus infection is a 4-fold rise in PRNT titers in paired acute and convalescent samples with antibodies to multiple dengue virus serotypes or other flaviviruses in the convalescent sample. PRNT performed on a single dengue IgM-positive specimen may show neutralizing antibody titers for dengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses included in the test. These results are classified as a recent flavivirus infection. Cases may be re-classified as another flavivirus, such as Zika, according to PRNT results. A negative PRNT or microneutralization results on a dengue IgM positive sample during acute illness may indicate no detectable neutralizing activity. An IgM positive result remains presumptive in the absence of other confirmatory tests results (PRNT, microneutralization tests, NS1 or NAAT). Availability PRNT and microneutralization tests are performed at CDC or a laboratory designated by CDC (i.e., a laboratory that has independently demonstrated proficiency to perform PRNT testing by completing a proficiency panel provided by CDC). Public health laboratories may refer IgM-positive specimens to CDC for PRNT to confirm positive, equivocal, or inconclusive IgM results. In some resource limited countries, PRNTs and microneutralization tests may not be available.

      "Generated text:  ['The lab report highlights key differences between patients with Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). Age and gender distributions show a higher proportion of males in the DHF group (75.0%) compared to DF (61.5%), though this difference is not statistically significant. Clinical presentation reveals significant differences, with DHF patients experiencing more severe symptoms such as rash (77.5% vs. 27.3%, p<0.001) and hemorrhage (72.5% vs. 3.7%, p<0.001). Fever is nearly universal in both groups, but cough is more common in DF (13.7% vs. 2.5%, p=0.033). Laboratory findings indicate more severe thrombocytopenia in DHF (90.0% vs. 76.8%, p=0.047) and higher rates of leukopenia (24.3% vs. 45.4%, p=0.015) and monocytosis (57.6% vs. 26.2%, p=0.001). Elevated liver enzymes, such as ALT (84.4% vs. 57.3%, p=0.004) and AST (96.2% vs. 86.1%, p=0.147), are also more pronounced in DHF, suggesting liver involvement.', 'The report underscores the progression from DF to DHF, marked by increased severity of symptoms like hemorrhage and rash, alongside laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. The higher prevalence of cough in DF and monocytosis in DHF further distinguishes the two conditions. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification and monitoring of patients with dengue to prevent complications associated with DHF.']\n",

Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1995. 291 DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION 3 Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC is a medical and haematological emergency. It may be seen in a variety of situations and is characterized by generalized bruising and bleeding, usu- ally from venepuncture sites, post-​operatively, and spontaneously. Diagnosis requires FBC, clotting screen, and evidence of rapid consump- tion of fibrinogen. Classic (acute) DIC, where the test results fit the bill, is easy to spot. The situation may be more subtle and you are strongly advised to discuss the case with a haematology registrar or consultant if you are in any doubt about the diagnosis of DIC.

Women who are Rh(D) negative and have a fetus who is Rh(D) positive can have a healthy pregnancy; however, in subsequent pregnancies, an Rh(D) positive fetus is at risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Therefore, Rh(D) negative women who are carrying an Rh(D) positive fetus are treated prophylactically with Rh(D) immunoglobulin at 28 weeks' gestation and within 72 hours of delivery.

Organ system /Panel delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. Rheumatoid factor (RF), serum IMM 1.4 <15 IU/mL RF is an antibody that reacts with the Fc portion of other immunoglobulin G antibodies. Despite its name, RF lacks speciﬁcity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can be seen in other inﬂammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, particularly Sj€ogren syndrome. RF can be a prognostic indicator in RA as its presence correlates with increased severity of disease. RF has a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of about 70% and 85% for RA, respectively. Combination of RF and anti- citrullinated peptide antibodies have a higher diagnostic yield than RF alone. Skeletal, Autoimmunity Salicylate, serum CHEM 1.7 Therapeutic: < 30 mg/dL Aspirin has a short half-life (15 min) and is rapidly metabolized to salicylate. In aspirin overdose, cyclooxygenase inhibition leads to platelet dysfunction and gastric mucosal injury; stimulation of the medulla resulting in hyperventilation, respiratory alkalosis, nausea and vomiting; and disruption of cellular metabolism (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) which can cause metabolic acidosis. Serum salicylate levels above 40 mg/dL typically result in toxicity. Symptom onset is usually within 3–8 h, but absorption rates are not uniform.

Rarely, random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in early embryonic life will result in a carrier's having a low enough factor VIII or IX level to experience abnormal bleeding. A patient with a factor VIII or IX level < 1% of normal has severe bleeding episodes throughout life. The first episode usually occurs before age 18 mo. Minor trauma can result in extensive tissue hemorrhages and hemarthroses, which, if improperly managed, can result in crippling musculoskeletal deformities. Bleeding into the base of the tongue, causing airway compression, Hematology 390 may be life threatening and requires prompt, vigorous replacement therapy. Even a trivial blow to the head requires replacement therapy to prevent intracranial bleeding. Patients with factor VIII or IX levels about 5% of normal have mild hemophilia. They rarely have spontaneous hemorrhages; however, they will bleed severely (even fatally) after surgery if not managed correctly. Occasional patients have even milder hemophilia with a factor VIII or IX level in the 10 to 30% of normal range. Such patients may also bleed excessively after surgery or dental extraction. Laboratory Findings By measuring the factor VIII level and comparing it with the level of VWF antigen, it is often possible to determine whether a female is a true carrier of hemophilia A. Similarly, measuring the factor IX level often identifies a carrier of hemophilia B. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA in the factor VIII gene amplified from lymphocytes is available at a few specialized centers. This test allows identification of the hemophilia A carrier, either directly by recognition of a known specific genomic defect in the pedigree, or indirectly through study of restriction fragment length Hematology 391 polymorphisms linked to the factor VIII gene. These techniques have also been applied to the diagnosis of hemophilia A\n",

High and low plasma viscosity A high PV generally signifies some underlying pathology, e.g. inflamma- tory states, paraproteinaemias such as MGUS or myeloma; low PV can be ignored. Note: despite the advantages outlined, the PV has not been adopted by all medical staff (who still prefer the ESR as a measure of inflammation). The PV is better for monitoring hyperviscosity syndromes, e.g. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia. The fact that both tests are still used shows that there is a role for both. E OHCM 10e, p. 373.

Infected cells produce so-​called hetero- phile antibodies (these are IgM molecules that agglutinate horse and sheep RBCs but do not agglutinate ox RBCs and do not react at all with guinea pig RBCs). There are various kits available that can detect the presence of hetero- phile antibodies and, in the right clinical context, will confirm a diagnosis of EBV infection. The Monospot test is probably the commonest in current use. The Paul–​Bunnell test was the first to demonstrate the presence of heterophile antibodies in patients with EBV infection. Clinical features Glandular fever often affects young adults (12–​25 years) and results in malaise, fever, tonsillitis, petechial haemorrhages on the palate, and lym- phadenopathy. Splenomegaly is fairly common. A similar clinical picture is seen in CMV, Toxoplasma, and early HIV infections. • Sample: EDTA. Positive Monospot • EBV infection.

Lymphocytosis: Lymphocytosis is a used to define higher- than-normal number of lymphocytes (absolute lymphocyte >4.5 x109/L). Normal range is 1.5 -4.5 x 109/L. Lymphocytes represent around 20 to 40% of WBC. If there is persistent lymphocytosis > 7 x 109/L with smear cells, it may necessary to request lymphocyte markers (flow immunophenotype) to rule out a lymphoproliferative disorder.

Basophilia: Basophils are the least numerous of the myelogenous cells with large blue granules. Basophilia is defined as basophil count of 0-0.1 x109/L. Basophilia in the presence of numerous circulating blasts suggests the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia. Elevation of basophils may also be representative of multiple other underlying neoplasms such as polycythemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis, thrombocythemia, or, in rare cases, solid tumors, allergic reactions or chronic inflammation related to infections such as tuberculosis, influenza, inflammatory bowel disorder, or an inflammatory autoimmune disease [96]. Chronic haemolytic anaemia and infectious diseases such as smallpox also demonstrate elevated basophil levels. Certain drug usage and food ingestion can also correlate with symptoms of basophilia [97]. Figure 10 shows the picture of a basophil. Figure 10:\n",

II. Eosinophils • Eosinophilia This is an increase eosinophil count above 0.5 x 109/ l and conditions associated with this include: allergic diseases (bronchial asthma, seasonal rhinitis), parasitic infections (trichinosis, taeniasis), skin disorders, chronic myelogenous leukemia • Eosinopenia This is a decrease in eosinophil count below 0.04 x 109/l and conditions associated with this include: acute stress due to secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid and epinephrine, acute inflammatory Hematology 127 states. III. Basophils • Basophilia This is an increase in basophil count above 0.2 x 109/l and conditions associated with this include: allergic reactions, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and polycythemia vera. IV. Monocytes • Monocytosis This is an increase in monocyte count above 1.0 x 109/l and conditions associated with this include: recovery from acute infections, tuberculosis, monocytic leukemia. • Monocytopenia This is a decrease in monocyte count below 0.2 x 109/l and conditions associated with this include: treatment with prednisone, hairy cell leukemia.

Blood film when WBC is decreased • Sometimes difficult to determine the diagnosis since so few WBCs. • May suggest B12 or folate deficiency (are the RBCs normal or large?). • Aplastic anaemia: are the platelets and Hb normal? • Underlying leukaemia: are there any leukaemic blasts* present? • Overwhelming infection: may see toxic granulation (large, dark granules in the cytoplasm—​not diagnostic, but suggestive). • May be immune or post-​viral: atypical lymphocytes may be seen; other indices usually normal. Note: a blast (*) is a primitive cell seen in the marrow in large numbers in leukaemia. We all have some blasts in our marrows, but these should be <5% of the total nucleated bone marrow cells in health. Blood film when WBC is increased What cell predominates? • Lymphocytes: suggests viral, CLL, acute leukaemia (lymphoblastic). • Granulocytic? (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils)—​may be reactive or CML. • Abnormal-​looking WBC? Look for Auer rods (≡ AML), smear cells (CLL), bilobed neutrophils (pseudo-​Pelger cells seen in MDS). (See Table 3.3.) Fig. 3.4 Blood film: atypical WBCs (this was from a patient with glandular fever, but these cells may be seen in any viral illness). White blood cell morphology 243 Diagnosis must be made in context How old is the patient? • Viral illnesses often produce bizarre films in children, but beware of complacency (acute leukaemia may be the cause). • MDS and malignancies like CLL and CML are diseases of older individuals. Is the patient well? • May be worth repeating the FBC and film to see if abnormalities have resolved. • If the patient is unwell or has lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, then an underlying disease must be excluded.

      "- the variety. Many VHF cases presenting together may suggest a bioterrorism attack. 2. VHFs are severe febrile illnesses that can be complicated by a haemorrhagic tendency, petechiae, hypotension (and even shock), ﬂushing of the face and chest, and oedema. Constitutional symptoms such as headaches, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea may occur. Some VHFs manifest particular features not shared by the others. 3. Once suspected, VHFs are category 4 pathogens, so precautions for healthcare workers must be instituted and the case notiﬁed to the proper authorities. Isolation measures and barrier nursing procedures are indicated (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa and Congo- Crimean HF viruses may be particularly prone to aerosol nosocomial spread), usually in a special infectious diseases/tropical medicine unit staﬀed with clinicians with expertise in the ﬁeld. Intensive supportive care may be required. 5. Almost always, the true diagnosis will not be a VHF, but they must be considered where appropriate. Strict adherence to isolation and infection control precautions has prevented secondary transmission in almost all cases. 4. Diagnosis requires clinical expertise in infectious diseases/tropical medicine. The diﬀerential diagnosis includes malaria, yellow fever, dengue, typhoid/ paratyphoid fever, non-typhoidal salmonellae, typhus and other rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, shigella dysentery, relapsing fever (borreliosis), fulminant hepatitis and meningo coccal disease. Antigen tests, antibody detection and viral culture are all available for most of the VHFs. The patient should be fully investigated and treated accordingly.

      "Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of dengue infection characterized by hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and plasma leakage. The clinical presentation of DHF often includes symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. Laboratory findings typically reveal thrombocytopenia, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The diagnosis of DHF requires a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and sometimes imaging studies to rule out other causes of hemorrhagic fever, such as malaria, yellow fever, or viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). \n",

      "In the context of VHFs, dengue hemorrhagic fever is one of the leading causes of severe febrile illness in tropical and subtropical regions. The clinical features of DHF overlap with those of other VHFs, including symptoms like hemorrhagic tendency, petechiae, flushing of the face and chest, and edema. Constitutional symptoms such as headaches, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. The diagnosis of DHF is confirmed by antigen tests, antibody detection, and sometimes viral culture. \n",

      "The management of DHF involves intensive supportive care, including fluid replacement, blood transfusions, and monitoring for complications such as shock or organ failure. Strict infection control measures are essential to prevent nosocomial transmission, especially in healthcare settings. The differential diagnosis for DHF includes malaria, yellow fever, typhoid/paratyphoid fever, leptospirosis, and other rickettsial diseases.
