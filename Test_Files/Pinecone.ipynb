      "['Since the 1970s, dengue has been classified as dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued a new, severity-based clinical classification which differs greatly from the previous classification. Dengue virus infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations.', 'To diagnose Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), the following 4 clinical criteria are required: \\n1. Fever, \\n2. Hemorrhagic tendency (spontaneous bleeding or a positive tourniquet test result), \\n3. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count, ≤100000 cells/mm3), \\n4. Plasma leakage as shown by pleural effusion, ascites, or ≥20% hemoconcentration. \\nA diagnosis of DHF does not require laboratory evidence of dengue virus infection.', 'To diagnose dengue, the presence of fever and at least 2 clinical findings or any warning signs are required, along with epidemiological or laboratory evidence. The clinical findings include aches and pains, nausea, vomiting, rash, abdominal pain and tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement. Severe dengue is defined as dengue with any of the following: (1) plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress, (2) severe bleeding, or (3) organ failure, such as elevated liver enzyme levels, impaired consciousness, or heart failure. Warning signs for potentially severe dengue include abdominal pain and tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement.', 'To identify severe dengue, the case definition is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings. The 2009 classification includes nonspecific warning signs as diagnostic criteria for probable and potentially severe dengue cases. Warning signs include abdominal pain and vomiting. Laboratory confirmation is not clearly stated for severe dengue in the 2009 classification, which may lead to inflating the number of dengue cases. The DHF case definition excludes 99% of nondengue cases without the need for laboratory tests. Severe dengue in the new classification includes cases with diverse and potentially unrelated underlying mechanisms, such as highly elevated liver enzyme levels, plasma leakage, or hemorrhage.', 'The severity of Dengue is based on clinical judgment and can lead to heterogeneity in classified groups. The 2009 definition of severe dengue reflects underlying disease severity and regional and local clinical practice. The dynamic nature of dengue demands close monitoring and repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations, including hematocrit and platelet counts. The DHF case classification has been useful for advancing important observations on dengue disease pathogenesis.', 'Dengue severity can be classified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme, which includes:\\n- Clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity of confirmed dengue infections\\n- Classification of dengue haemorrhagic fever\\n- Laboratory tests such as liver biochemical tests\\n- Hemodynamic studies of clinical shock associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nRelevant studies and guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and control of dengue haemorrhagic fever include:\\n- WHO Technical guides (1975, 1997)\\n- WHO Dengue guidelines (2009)\\n- Studies on dengue classification in various countries (2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011)', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever can manifest with unusual clinical presentations, including fulminant liver failure, fulminant hepatitis, and neurological manifestations such as febrile encephalopathy and central nervous system involvement. The World Health Organization definition for identification of severe cases of dengue can be used to classify the severity of the infection. Serologic tests can be used for diagnosis. Clinical features and laboratory tests, such as liver function tests, can aid in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease.', 'To interpret the medical report related to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (test), the following information is useful:\\n\\n* Positive IgM: indicates presumptive, recent dengue virus infections.\\n* Negative IgM: \\n  - Between days 0–7 of illness, and absent or negative NAAT or NS1 results, are considered unconfirmed cases.\\n  - After 7 days of symptoms, and absent or negative NAAT or NS1, are classified as negative for recent infection.\\n* Change from negative to positive IgM results in paired samples: indicates current dengue infections.\\n* Seroconversion (change from negative to positive) in paired samples: diagnoses current dengue.\\n* Negative results on both acute and convalescent samples: indicates the patient was not infected with dengue virus.', 'To interpret a medical report related to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) test, consider the following:\\n\\n* The presence of IgM antibodies may indicate a previous dengue virus infection.\\n* Cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses and possible nonspecific reactivity may make IgM and IgG results difficult to interpret.\\n* Presumed positive, indeterminate, and equivocal IgM antibody test results may require confirmation by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Testing (PRNT).\\n* PRNT can detect and measure the titer of specific neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus and other flaviviruses.\\n* A single PRNT test result cannot determine infection timing, but PRNT results from paired acute and convalescent specimens can confirm recent infection.\\n* A 4-fold rise in PRNT titers in paired acute and convalescent samples indicates a recent flavivirus infection.\\n* PRNT performed on a dengue IgM-positive specimen showing neutralizing antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype confirms recent infection with that serotype.\\n* Seroconversion from a negative PRNT in an acute sample to a positive PRNT with antibodies to only one dengue virus serotype in a convalescent sample confirms a recent infection with that serotype.', 'A negative PRNT or microneutralization results on a dengue IgM positive sample during acute illness may indicate no detectable neutralizing activity. An IgM positive result remains presumptive in the absence of other confirmatory tests results (PRNT, microneutralization tests, NS1 or NAAT). \\n\\nIgM Antibody Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (MAC-ELISA) and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and microneutralization tests are used for diagnosis. \\n\\nPublic health laboratories may refer IgM-positive specimens to CDC for PRNT to confirm positive, equivocal, or inconclusive IgM results.']\n"

      "Generated text:  ['The lab report highlights key differences between patients with Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). Age and gender distributions show a higher proportion of males in the DHF group (75.0%) compared to DF (61.5%), though this difference is not statistically significant. Clinical presentation reveals significant differences, with DHF patients experiencing more severe symptoms such as rash (77.5% vs. 27.3%, p<0.001) and hemorrhage (72.5% vs. 3.7%, p<0.001). Fever is nearly universal in both groups, but cough is more common in DF (13.7% vs. 2.5%, p=0.033). Laboratory findings indicate more severe thrombocytopenia in DHF (90.0% vs. 76.8%, p=0.047) and higher rates of leukopenia (24.3% vs. 45.4%, p=0.015) and monocytosis (57.6% vs. 26.2%, p=0.001). Elevated liver enzymes, such as ALT (84.4% vs. 57.3%, p=0.004) and AST (96.2% vs. 86.1%, p=0.147), are also more pronounced in DHF, suggesting liver involvement.', 'The report underscores the progression from DF to DHF, marked by increased severity of symptoms like hemorrhage and rash, alongside laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. The higher prevalence of cough in DF and monocytosis in DHF further distinguishes the two conditions. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification and monitoring of patients with dengue to prevent complications associated with DHF.']\n",

Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1995. 291 DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION 3 Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC is a medical and haematological emergency. It may be seen in a variety of situations and is characterized by generalized bruising and bleeding, usu- ally from venepuncture sites, post-​operatively, and spontaneously. Diagnosis requires FBC, clotting screen, and evidence of rapid consump- tion of fibrinogen. Classic (acute) DIC, where the test results fit the bill, is easy to spot. The situation may be more subtle and you are strongly advised to discuss the case with a haematology registrar or consultant if you are in any doubt about the diagnosis of DIC.

Organ system /Panel delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. Rheumatoid factor (RF), serum IMM 1.4 <15 IU/mL RF is an antibody that reacts with the Fc portion of other immunoglobulin G antibodies. Despite its name, RF lacks speciﬁcity for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can be seen in other inﬂammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, particularly Sj€ogren syndrome. RF can be a prognostic indicator in RA as its presence correlates with increased severity of disease. RF has a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of about 70% and 85% for RA, respectively. Combination of RF and anti- citrullinated peptide antibodies have a higher diagnostic yield than RF alone. Skeletal, Autoimmunity Salicylate, serum CHEM 1.7 Therapeutic: < 30 mg/dL Aspirin has a short half-life (15 min) and is rapidly metabolized to salicylate. In aspirin overdose, cyclooxygenase inhibition leads to platelet dysfunction and gastric mucosal injury; stimulation of the medulla resulting in hyperventilation, respiratory alkalosis, nausea and vomiting; and disruption of cellular metabolism (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) which can cause metabolic acidosis. Serum salicylate levels above 40 mg/dL typically result in toxicity. Symptom onset is usually within 3–8 h, but absorption rates are not uniform.

Rarely, random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in early embryonic life will result in a carrier's having a low enough factor VIII or IX level to experience abnormal bleeding. A patient with a factor VIII or IX level < 1% of normal has severe bleeding episodes throughout life. The first episode usually occurs before age 18 mo. Minor trauma can result in extensive tissue hemorrhages and hemarthroses, which, if improperly managed, can result in crippling musculoskeletal deformities. Bleeding into the base of the tongue, causing airway compression, Hematology 390 may be life threatening and requires prompt, vigorous replacement therapy. Even a trivial blow to the head requires replacement therapy to prevent intracranial bleeding. Patients with factor VIII or IX levels about 5% of normal have mild hemophilia. They rarely have spontaneous hemorrhages; however, they will bleed severely (even fatally) after surgery if not managed correctly. Occasional patients have even milder hemophilia with a factor VIII or IX level in the 10 to 30% of normal range. Such patients may also bleed excessively after surgery or dental extraction. Laboratory Findings By measuring the factor VIII level and comparing it with the level of VWF antigen, it is often possible to determine whether a female is a true carrier of hemophilia A. Similarly, measuring the factor IX level often identifies a carrier of hemophilia B. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA in the factor VIII gene amplified from lymphocytes is available at a few specialized centers. This test allows identification of the hemophilia A carrier, either directly by recognition of a known specific genomic defect in the pedigree, or indirectly through study of restriction fragment length Hematology 391 polymorphisms linked to the factor VIII gene. These techniques have also been applied to the diagnosis of hemophilia A\n",

High and low plasma viscosity A high PV generally signifies some underlying pathology, e.g. inflamma- tory states, paraproteinaemias such as MGUS or myeloma; low PV can be ignored. Note: despite the advantages outlined, the PV has not been adopted by all medical staff (who still prefer the ESR as a measure of inflammation). The PV is better for monitoring hyperviscosity syndromes, e.g. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia. The fact that both tests are still used shows that there is a role for both. E OHCM 10e, p. 373.

Infected cells produce so-​called hetero- phile antibodies (these are IgM molecules that agglutinate horse and sheep RBCs but do not agglutinate ox RBCs and do not react at all with guinea pig RBCs). There are various kits available that can detect the presence of hetero- phile antibodies and, in the right clinical context, will confirm a diagnosis of EBV infection. The Monospot test is probably the commonest in current use. The Paul–​Bunnell test was the first to demonstrate the presence of heterophile antibodies in patients with EBV infection. Clinical features Glandular fever often affects young adults (12–​25 years) and results in malaise, fever, tonsillitis, petechial haemorrhages on the palate, and lym- phadenopathy. Splenomegaly is fairly common. A similar clinical picture is seen in CMV, Toxoplasma, and early HIV infections. • Sample: EDTA. Positive Monospot • EBV infection.

Lymphocytes represent around 20 to 40% of WBC. If there is persistent lymphocytosis > 7 x 109/L with smear cells, it may necessary to request lymphocyte markers (flow immunophenotype) to rule out a lymphoproliferative disorder.

Basophilia in the presence of numerous circulating blasts suggests the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia. Elevation of basophils may also be representative of multiple other underlying neoplasms such as polycythemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis, thrombocythemia, or, in rare cases, solid tumors, allergic reactions or chronic inflammation related to infections such as tuberculosis, influenza, inflammatory bowel disorder, or an inflammatory autoimmune disease [96]. Chronic haemolytic anaemia and infectious diseases such as smallpox also demonstrate elevated basophil levels. Certain drug usage and food ingestion can also correlate with symptoms of basophilia [97]. Figure 10 shows the picture of a basophil. Figure 10:\n",

VHFs are severe febrile illnesses that can be complicated by a haemorrhagic tendency, petechiae, hypotension (and even shock), ﬂushing of the face and chest, and oedema. Constitutional symptoms such as headaches, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea may occur. Some VHFs manifest particular features not shared by the others. 3. Once suspected, VHFs are category 4 pathogens, so precautions for healthcare workers must be instituted and the case notiﬁed to the proper authorities. Isolation measures and barrier nursing procedures are indicated (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa and Congo- Crimean HF viruses may be particularly prone to aerosol nosocomial spread), usually in a special infectious diseases/tropical medicine unit staﬀed with clinicians with expertise in the ﬁeld. Intensive supportive care may be required. 5. Almost always, the true diagnosis will not be a VHF, but they must be considered where appropriate. Strict adherence to isolation and infection control precautions has prevented secondary transmission in almost all cases. 4. Diagnosis requires clinical expertise in infectious diseases/tropical medicine. The diﬀerential diagnosis includes malaria, yellow fever, dengue, typhoid/ paratyphoid fever, non-typhoidal salmonellae, typhus and other rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, shigella dysentery, relapsing fever (borreliosis), fulminant hepatitis and meningo coccal disease. Antigen tests, antibody detection and viral culture are all available for most of the VHFs. The patient should be fully investigated and treated accordingly.
